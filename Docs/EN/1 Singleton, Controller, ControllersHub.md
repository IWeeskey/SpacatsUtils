### Overview
You have a small infrastructure built around three pieces:
- `Singleton<T>`: a reusable, editor-friendly MonoBehaviour singleton base.
- `Controller`: a base class for feature modules that are auto-registered into a hub and can be centrally updated and filtered by scene.
- `ControllersHub`: a singleton that owns all `Controller` instances, enforces uniqueness, routes lifecycle calls, and provides lookup.

Below I explain how each works, why they exist, and what the key public fields and methods are for.

---

### How the base `Singleton<T>` works
`Singleton<T>` is an `ExecuteInEditMode` MonoBehaviour that provides a single globally accessible instance of `T` and a controlled lifecycle with extra hooks.

- Instance creation and access
  - Static property `Instance` lazily finds or creates the singleton:
    - `FindFirstObjectByType<T>()` is tried first.
    - If not found, it creates a new `GameObject`, names it `typeof(T).Name`, adds `T`, and immediately calls `SSetDefaultParameters()` so the derived class can set initial flags safely when the instance is auto-created.
  - `HasInstance` indicates if `_instance` is set.
  - `IsInstance` checks if `this` is the current instance.

- Lifetime management
  - On first `Awake` (or after domain reload): if `_instance` is null or the app is quitting, it assigns `this` to `_instance`, clears the quitting flag, and `DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject)` while playing. Otherwise, if a second instance appears, it logs a warning and destroys the new one.
  - It subscribes to Unity scene events when enabled (`SceneManager.sceneUnloaded` and `sceneLoaded`) and unsubscribes when disabled.
  - In editor, it also hooks `SceneView.duringSceneGui` to provide a unified update while editing (see `SSharedUpdate`).

- Centralized, overrideable hooks (the “S*” methods)
  - `SAwake`, `SOnEnable`, `SOnDisable`, `SOnDestroy`, `SOnApplicationQuit`, `SSetDefaultParameters`, `SOnSceneUnloading`, `SOnSceneLoaded`, `SUpdate`, `SLateUpdate`, `SSharedUpdate`, and editor-only `SingletonOnSceneGUI`.
  - These wrap Unity’s built-in callbacks, adding consistent logging, hierarchy normalization, and editor support. Derive from them instead of overriding Unity methods directly so the singleton guarantees and subscriptions remain intact.

- Hierarchy control
  - `AlwaysOnTop`: when true, `CheckHierarchy()` keeps the object at the top level and first sibling, and normalizes transform to identity.

- Logging control
  - `ShowLogs`: for your own (feature) logs from derived classes (non-singleton logs).
  - `ShowSLogs`: for singleton-infrastructure logs (the S* lifecycle/logging). The method `TryToShowLog(message, logType, isSingletonLog)` filters by these flags, always allowing `Error/Exception` through.

Why this is useful: it gives one stable instance with predictable calls in both Play Mode and Edit Mode, consistent logging, "always on top" organization, and scene-event routing without each derived class re-implementing all the boilerplate.

---

### How the `Controller` base class works
`Controller` is a regular MonoBehaviour (also `ExecuteInEditMode`) that registers itself into `ControllersHub` and exposes a parallel set of lifecycle hooks with a `C*` prefix. Controllers are intended to be small, focused feature modules managed centrally by the hub.

- Key public fields
  - `UniqueTag` (string): disambiguates multiple controllers of the same type. `ControllersHub` enforces uniqueness per type+tag.
  - `ExecuteInEditor` (bool): if false and we’re not in Play Mode, the controller’s `C*` callbacks won’t run.
  - `ShowLogs` (bool): for your own feature logs inside the controller.
  - `ShowCLogs` (bool): for controller-infrastructure logs (C* lifecycle/logging). Errors/exceptions are always shown regardless of flags.
  - `PersistsAtScenes` (List<string>): scene allow-list. If empty, the controller persists across all scenes. If non-empty, on scene load if the scene name is NOT in the list, the controller auto-destroys itself.

- Registration with the hub
  - On `Awake` and `OnEnable`, it calls `TryRegister()`; the hub enforces uniqueness. If registration fails (duplicate type & tag), the controller logs a warning and calls `DestroyController()`.
  - On `OnDisable`, if registered, it calls `COnRegisteredDisable()` and unregisters from the hub.

- Controller lifecycle (the “C*” methods)
  - Overridable hooks mirror Unity’s callbacks and updates:
    - `CAwake`, `COnEnable`, `COnDisable`, `COnDestroy`, `COnApplicationQuit`, `COnRegister` (called once registration succeeds), `COnRegisteredEnable`/`COnRegisteredDisable` (only when registered), `COnSceneUnloading`, `COnSceneLoaded`, and per-frame calls `CUpdate`, `CLateUpdate`, `CSharedUpdate`.
  - Unity’s built-ins (`Awake`, `OnEnable`, etc.) are kept private in `Controller` to guarantee the registration flow and the editor filtering happen consistently. You implement behavior via the `C*` versions.

- Editor and scene behavior
  - Name/transform management: `RefreshName()` names the GameObject as `[SpaCats] <TypeName> <UniqueTag>` for clarity.
  - `CheckHierarchy()` re-parents the controller under `ControllersHub.Instance.transform` and normalizes transform.
  - `ExternalOnSceneLoaded(scene, mode)` applies `PersistsAtScenes` logic: if the scene name is not in the allow-list, the controller destroys itself; otherwise it forwards to `COnSceneLoaded`.

- Destruction
  - `DestroyController()` unregisters from the hub and destroys the GameObject (`DestroyImmediate` in editor, `Destroy` in play mode).

Why this is useful: it standardizes lifecycle and logging, guarantees central ownership, prevents accidental duplicates, and gives clean per-scene persistence without scattering logic through each controller.

---

### What `ControllersHub` does and why it’s needed
`ControllersHub` derives from `Singleton<ControllersHub>`. It is the single registry and dispatcher for all active `Controller` instances.

- Central registry
  - Maintains a private list `_controllers` of registered controllers.
  - `RegisterController(Controller controller)`:
    - Rejects duplicates of the same instance.
    - Calls `IsUnique(controller)` to enforce uniqueness among controllers of the same runtime type by `UniqueTag`.
    - On success, adds to `_controllers`.
  - `UnRegisterController(Controller controller)` removes it from the list.
  - `Clear()` resets the registry (e.g., around domain reloads/enable/disable).

- Enforcing uniqueness by `UniqueTag`
  - `IsUnique(controller)` groups existing controllers by exact type and compares `UniqueTag` strings. If there is already one with the same type and tag, registration fails. Different tags allow multiple instances of the same type to coexist.

- Lookup
  - `GetController<T>(string tag = "")` returns the first `T` if `tag` is empty, or the one matching `UniqueTag` if provided. If not found, it logs an error.

- Lifecycle routing
  - All `S*` methods in the hub forward to the `C*` methods on each registered controller, with Play Mode vs Edit Mode filtering respected via each controller’s `ExecuteInEditor` flag:
    - `SUpdate` → `CUpdate`
    - `SLateUpdate` → `CLateUpdate`
    - `SSharedUpdate` → `CSharedUpdate` (also called from scene GUI in editor)
    - `SOnSceneUnloading` → `COnSceneUnloading`
    - `SOnSceneLoaded` → `ExternalOnSceneLoaded` (so `PersistsAtScenes` can prune controllers per scene)
  - This central dispatching is the reason controllers don’t rely solely on Unity’s own per-object update; you get one place to pause/enable/control all controllers in editor and play mode consistently.

- Safety around hub destruction
  - `HandleDestroyLogic()` is called in `SOnDestroy` to detach controllers and re-enable them so they are not inadvertently disabled/destroyed with the hub.

- Editor support
  - Editor-only `SingletonOnSceneGUI` in the hub forwards to each controller’s `COnSceneGUI`, and also drives `CSharedUpdate` via the singleton’s editor hook. This lets controllers run tools and debug visuals in the Scene view smoothly.

- Defaults and appearance
  - In `SSetDefaultParameters()`, the hub sets `ShowLogs = false`, `ShowSLogs = false`, `AlwaysOnTop = true`, and calls `CheckHierarchy()`. It also renames itself to `[SpaCats] ControllersHub` for clear identification.

Why this is needed: without a central hub you’d duplicate registration, lifetime coordination, and editor-update plumbing across every controller. The hub gives you one place for routing, uniqueness, lookups, and debugging.

### Controller `UniqueTag` logic and other public fields
- `UniqueTag`
  - Enforced by `ControllersHub.IsUnique`: among controllers of the same exact type, two cannot share the same `UniqueTag`. This allows multiple instances of the same controller class to coexist as long as they have different tags (e.g., multiple audio buses or UI panels of the same class).
  - Used by `ControllersHub.GetController<T>(tag)` to retrieve the expected instance.

- `ExecuteInEditor`
  - When false and not playing, the controller won’t run `C*` lifecycle/update calls, but still registers to maintain hub routing (it checks before calling `C*`). This prevents editor-time spam while keeping consistent structure.

- `ShowLogs` and `ShowCLogs`
  - `ShowLogs`: intended for your controller’s feature-level logs (e.g., state changes, business logic). These are emitted when `isControllerLog` is false in `TryToShowLog`.
  - `ShowCLogs`: intended for the controller framework/lifecycle logs (e.g., `Awake`, `OnEnable`, register/unregister). These are emitted when `isControllerLog` is true.
  - Errors and exceptions always log regardless of these flags.

- `PersistsAtScenes`
  - If empty: the controller persists across all scene loads.
  - If non-empty: only survives scene loads whose `scene.name` exists in the list; otherwise it self-destroys on `OnSceneLoaded` via `ExternalOnSceneLoaded`.

---

### Difference between `ShowLogs` and `ShowCLogs` (and the Singleton analog)
- In `Controller`:
  - `ShowLogs` → your own controller logic logs.
  - `ShowCLogs` → controller-infrastructure and lifecycle logs (C* calls).
- In `Singleton<T>`:
  - `ShowLogs` → your own feature logs inside the singleton.
  - `ShowSLogs` (analog of `ShowCLogs`) → singleton-infrastructure and lifecycle logs (S* calls).
- Both bases always allow `Error` and `Exception` logs to pass through, regardless of flags.

---

### Why methods like `CAwake`, `COnEnable` etc. exist (and the similar ones in `Singleton<T>`)
These prefixed methods serve several purposes:

1) Separation of concerns and safety
   - The base classes keep Unity callbacks (`Awake`, `OnEnable`, etc.) private/internal so they can guarantee:
     - Proper registration/unregistration with the hub.
     - Consistent editor/play filtering (`ExecuteInEditor`).
     - Correct ordering (e.g., `TryRegister()` before `COnRegisteredEnable`).
   - You implement behavior in `C*`/`S*` overrides without breaking the framework’s operational guarantees.

2) Centralized logging and diagnostics
   - The base class wraps calls with `TryToShowLog`, so you can toggle lifecycle logs (`ShowCLogs`/`ShowSLogs`) separately from feature logs (`ShowLogs`).

3) Editor-time execution control
   - `CSharedUpdate`/`SSharedUpdate` are triggered each frame and during `SceneView` GUI in editor, enabling smooth in-editor tools and previews without entering Play Mode.

4) Consistent scene-event routing
   - The singleton subscribes to Unity scene events once. It then calls `SOnSceneLoaded`/`SOnSceneUnloading`, and the hub fans those out to controllers (`ExternalOnSceneLoaded`/`COnSceneUnloading`).

5) Extensibility and testability
   - Derived classes override the prefixed methods, which are easier to mock/unit test than Unity’s sealed message methods.

### Typical usage examples
- Create a hub-managed controller
  ```csharp
  public class AudioController : Controller
  {
      public override void CUpdate()
      {
          // Feature logic
          if (ShowLogs) Debug.Log("Tick");
      }

      protected override void COnRegister()
      {
          // Initialize after successful registration
      }

      public override void COnSceneLoaded(Scene scene, LoadSceneMode mode)
      {
          // React to scene load when allowed by PersistsAtScenes
      }
  }
  ```

- Retrieve a controller somewhere else
  ```csharp
  var audio = ControllersHub.Instance.GetController<AudioController>(tag: "Main");
  if (audio != null) { /* use it */ }
  ```

- Create your own singleton
  ```csharp
  public class GameServices : Singleton<GameServices>
  {
      protected override void SSetDefaultParameters()
      {
          base.SSetDefaultParameters();
          AlwaysOnTop = true;
          ShowSLogs = true; // See lifecycle messages
      }

      protected override void SUpdate()
      {
          // Per-frame service work
      }
  }
  ```

### Key takeaways
- `Singleton<T>` gives one stable, editor-aware instance with structured lifecycle hooks and logging.
- `Controller` modules register into `ControllersHub` and are driven centrally, with per-scene persistence and duplicate-prevention via `UniqueTag`.
- `ControllersHub` routes updates, scene events, editor GUI updates, and provides lookup and uniqueness enforcement.
- `ShowLogs` is for your feature logs; `ShowCLogs`/`ShowSLogs` are for framework lifecycle logs.
- `C*`/`S*` hooks exist so the framework can manage Unity callbacks safely while giving you clear override points for behavior.
